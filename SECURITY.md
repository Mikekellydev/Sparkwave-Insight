# Security Policy

At Sparkwave-Insights, security is a top priority. Since this project deals with IT security data, dashboards, and remediation workflows, we ask all contributors and users to follow responsible security practices.

## Supported Versions

We currently support the main branch (main) for security updates.
Older or experimental branches may not receive patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do NOT open a public GitHub issue.

Public issues may expose the vulnerability before it is fixed.

Contact the maintainer directly:

üìß info@sparkwaveitservice.com

Provide as much detail as possible:

Steps to reproduce the issue

Potential impact

Suggested remediation (if known)

You will receive a confirmation within 72 hours, and we will coordinate on a fix.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow a ‚Äúdisclose privately, fix quickly, acknowledge responsibly‚Äù approach:

Vulnerabilities will be validated and patched before any public disclosure.

Contributors who report security issues responsibly will be acknowledged (unless they prefer to remain anonymous).

Security Best Practices for Contributors

Never commit secrets (API keys, credentials, tokens).

Use environment variables or configuration files excluded from version control.

Test changes with mock data rather than production data.

Follow secure coding practices when handling authentication, logging, or APIs.

## Scope
